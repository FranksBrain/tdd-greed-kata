# TDD Greed Kata
**C# / xUnit Demo of the Greed Kata using Test Driven Development**

This repo contains Visual Studio 2017 solution and project files that are meant to supplement the blog posts [Intro to Test Driven Development (TDD) Part 1](http://franksbrain.com/2019/07/03/intro-to-test-driven-development-tdd-part-1/) and [Intro to Test Driven Development (TDD) Part 2](http://franksbrain.com/2019/07/30/intro-to-test-driven-development-tdd-part-2/).  It is the final, working version of the steps outlined in the blog.

This project uses C# (.net core), and xUnit for unit tests.
